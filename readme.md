Designed and implemented an IoT system using ESP8266
NodeMCU and DHT11 sensor for real-time temperature and hu-
midity monitoring, integrated with Blynk IoT platform. Devel-
oped hardware with fan and buzzer for automated control, pro-
grammed using Arduino IDE, and achieved stable Wi-Fi connectiv-
ity, ś2řC temperature accuracy, ś5 percent RH humidity accuracy,
and <1s data update rate. System supports remote monitoring,
automated alerts, and control, suitable for smart homes and in-
dustrial applications.
